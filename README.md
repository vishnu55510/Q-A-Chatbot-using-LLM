# Q&A Chatbot Development with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository focuses on experimenting with the LangChain library for building powerful applications with large language models (LLMs). By leveraging state-of-the-art language models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo (and soon GPT-4), this project showcases how to create a searchable database from a YouTube video transcript, perform similarity search queries using the FAISS library, and respond to user questions with relevant and precise information.

LangChain is a comprehensive framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It goes beyond merely calling an LLM via an API, as the most advanced and differentiated applications are also data-aware and agentic, enabling language models to connect with other data sources and interact with their environment. The LangChain framework is specifically built to address these principles.


# LangChain
The Python-specific portion of LangChain's documentation covers several main modules, each providing examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules include:

Models: Various model types and model integrations supported by LangChain.

Prompts: Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.

Memory: State persistence between chain or agent calls, including a standard memory interface, memory implementations, and examples of chains and agents utilizing memory.

Indexes: Combining LLMs with custom text data to enhance their capabilities.

Chains: Sequences of calls, either to an LLM or a different utility, with a standard interface, integrations, and end-to-end chain examples.

Agents: LLMs that make decisions about actions, observe the results, and repeat the process until completion, with a standard interface, agent selection, and end-to-end agent examples.


# Use Cases
With LangChain, developers can create various applications, such as customer support chatbots, automated content generators, data analysis tools, and intelligent search engines. These applications can help businesses streamline their workflows, reduce manual labor, and improve customer experiences.
