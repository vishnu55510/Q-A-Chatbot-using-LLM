This repository focuses on experimenting with the LangChain library for building powerful applications with large language models (LLMs). By leveraging state-of-the-art language models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo (and soon GPT-4), this project showcases how to create a searchable database from a YouTube video transcript, perform similarity search queries using the FAISS library, and respond to user questions with relevant and precise information.

LangChain is a comprehensive framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It goes beyond merely calling an LLM via an API, as the most advanced and differentiated applications are also data-aware and agentic, enabling language models to connect with other data sources and interact with their environment. The LangChain framework is specifically built to address these principles.
