# Q&A Chatbot Development with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository focuses on experimenting with the LangChain library for building powerful applications with large language models (LLMs). By leveraging state-of-the-art language models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo (and soon GPT-4)

LangChain is a comprehensive framework designed for developing applications powered by language models. It goes beyond merely calling an LLM via an API, as the most advanced and differentiated applications are also data-aware and agentic, enabling language models to connect with other data sources and interact with their environment. The LangChain framework is specifically built to address these principles.


# LangChain
The Python-specific portion of LangChain's documentation covers several main modules, each providing examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules include:

Models: Various model types and model integrations supported by LangChain.

Prompts: Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.

Memory: State persistence between chain or agent calls, including a standard memory interface, memory implementations, and examples of chains and agents utilizing memory.

Indexes: Combining LLMs with custom text data to enhance their capabilities.

Chains: Sequences of calls, either to an LLM or a different utility, with a standard interface, integrations, and end-to-end chain examples.

Agents: LLMs that make decisions about actions, observe the results, and repeat the process until completion, with a standard interface, agent selection, and end-to-end agent examples.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Update Conda to ensure you have the latest version:
    ```bash
    conda update conda
    ```

2. Add the conda-forge channel to your Conda configuration:
    ```bash
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    ```

3. Set channel priority to strict to ensure package versions are resolved correctly:
    ```bash
    conda config --set channels_priority strict
    ```

4. Create a virtual environment named `venv` with Python 3.9 using conda-forge:
    ```bash
    conda create -p venv python=3.9 -c conda-forge -y
    ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate ./venv
    ```

6. Install required packages from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. Install IPython kernel for Jupyter:
    ```bash
    pip install ipykernel
    ```
8. This command tells Streamlit to run your application with app.py as the entry point:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```


## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [LangChain library](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/introduction/)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

# Use Cases
With LangChain, developers can create various applications, such as customer support chatbots, automated content generators, data analysis tools, and intelligent search engines. These applications can help businesses streamline their workflows, reduce manual labor, and improve customer experiences.
